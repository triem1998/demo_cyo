# demo_cyo

Self-supervised cryo-ET denoising using **Equivariant Imaging (EI)** with missing-wedge physics and cube-symmetry rotations. 

Two training modes:
- **patch** — crop-based, fast,
- **full** — whole-tomogram tiled, slow

## Quick start

### Cluster setup (Jean Zay / SLURM)

```bash
# 1. Load the PyTorch module (provides torch, numpy, scipy, etc.)
module load pytorch-gpu/py3/2.7.0

# 2. Install extra dependencies not bundled in the module
pip install --user mrcfile

# deepinv must be installed from this PR (not the PyPI release):
#   https://github.com/deepinv/deepinv/pull/1088
git clone https://github.com/deepinv/deepinv.git
cd deepinv && git fetch origin pull/1088/head:pr-1088 && git checkout pr-1088
pip install --user -e . && cd ..

# 3. Submit a job (set execution_mode: submitit in the config)
python main.py --config configs/conf_equivariant_patch.yml
python main.py --config configs/conf_equivariant_full.yml
```

## Key methods

### Patch training

Similar to IceCream's patch-based training with a few differences:

- **Multi-GPU (DDP)**: wraps the model in `DistributedDataParallel` when `world_size > 1`. Each GPU gets its own shard of the dataset via a `DistributedSampler`, so effective batch size scales linearly with GPU count.
- **Memory-mapped volumes**: volumes are loaded with `mrcfile` in memory-map mode (`mode="r"`), so only the patches actually sampled are paged into RAM — allows training on datasets larger than available memory.
- **Mixed-volume batches**: each batch draws `n_crops_per_vol` patches from every volume in the dataset per epoch, so a single batch contains patches from multiple tomograms. This differs from IceCream which iterates one volume at a time.
- **Not yet implemented**: IceCream has an option to bias patch sampling toward regions with more information content rather than uniform random sampling. Our sampler is purely random. This can be added in the future if needed.

### Full-volume training

Uses deepinv's [distributed tiling framework](https://github.com/deepinv/deepinv/pull/1088) (`deepinv.distributed.distribute`) to run the UNet/drunet on a whole tomogram by splitting it into overlapping 3D tiles, processing each tile on a GPU, and stitching results back — no spatial downsampling.

**Current dataset handling**: the raw EMPIAR-11830 volumes are `1024×1024×512` (D×H×W). To keep things simple the dataset centre-crops each volume to a cube of side `min(D, H, W) = 512`, giving `512³` tensors fed to the trainer. A decision is still needed on how to utilize the full volume, e.g., center cropping, random 512³ cropping, or alternative patch-sampling strategies.
